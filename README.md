- When the user clicks on Movies (or music), he'll see a list of available movies along with a search bar, where he can write his favorite movie's name. 

- If the user liked a movie, he can click on 'More' button. A pop up will show that contains the movies cover, rating, and summary, along with two buttons to either watch the trailer or the movie. 

- If the user wanted to listen to music, he can scroll down to the music section, where he'll see a list of available music videos.
